[Energy data from a CurrentCost Envi to NSLU2] (http://www.plentyways.com/blog/2009/09/how-i-created-my-home-energy-monitor/)
======================

The CurrentCost Envi is an energy monitor that gives a real time output of your home electricity use. Simply slip a battery powered coil around a wire in your electricity meter and you're done. 
Unfortunately the CurrentCost doesn't do much apart from display your current energy use, which makes it pretty useless for trying to monitor trends and savings. Fortunately the CurrentCost has an RJ45 output, so with some cheap(ish) equipment and some jiggery pokery you can get your data out.

+ A CurrentCost Envi
